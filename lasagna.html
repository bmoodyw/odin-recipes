    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Homemade lasagna is the best. It tastes nothing like the ones from the 
    frozen food aisle. This recipe is so good—it’s the kind of lasagna people 
    write home about! It brings together all of the things we love in a good 
    pasta dish: noodles, cheeses, fresh herbs and a delicious meat sauce. 
    If you’ve never made lasagna before or haven’t found a good recipe, 
    you have come to the right place. Invite a friend because you won’t want to keep 
    this dish to <strong>yourself!</strong></p>

    <h2>Pasta Shortcut</h2>
        <p>Boiling lasagna noodles is an extra step that we would all love to avoid. 
            No boil lasagna noodles, in our opinion, have an unpleasant texture and 
            often turn out soggy. A hack to skip boiling is to place regular lasagna 
            noodles in a 9×13 pan and pour hot water over them. Let them soak for 30 
            minutes, and they’ll be tender enough to use in the recipe. Don’t worry, 
            they will finish cooking in the oven.
